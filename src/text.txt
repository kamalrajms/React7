## react intro

    What is React?

    1) React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces (UIs), especially Single Page Applications (SPAs).

    2) It helps developers build reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes.

    Instead of reloading a whole webpage when something changes, React updates only the parts of the UI that need to change.

    -------
    Why do we need React? 

	It makes UI development faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

	Provides a better user experience with smooth updates without page reloads.

        node module             -- all installed dependencies..
        puplic                  -- public assets  like img
        src                     --main source folder
            assets              -- images ,svg

            App.jsx             -- main app component
            main.jsx            --  starting point of our Applications
            index.css           -- global styleing file
        .gitignore              -- tells git which files to ignore
        package.json            -- Project info & dependencies
        package-lock.json       -- it represent node modules dependencies and version
        vite.config.json        -- vite configuration files
        READM.module            -- project documentation.
        

## props

    props is  nothing but passing data from one
    component to another component.

        declearing props
        destructuring a props

## conditional rendering 

    conditional rendering  means showing or hiding Parts of UI based 
    on some conndition...

        Ternary operator (condition1 ? true:false)
        logical operator (&& || !)

        t,t=true
        f,t=false
        t,f=false
        f,f=false

## useState() and handleing forms

    useState is a react hook that allows you to add state (data that can 
    changes over time) to a functional component.

    normally , in js functions ,variables disappear after the function runs,but
    with useState ,  react remember values between re-renders.

    syntex: 
        const[state,setState]=useState(initiate_state)

        state---the current value of the state variable.
        setState--- a function that updates the state.
        initiate_state-- the starting value  of the state.

## styleing in react 

    Global style   --index.ccs,App.css
    External style  -- seperate css file
    Inline style
    module way of style ---  we need to  add the extenser as [fileName.module.css]
    Object style

## list rendering

    Rendering multiple items dynamically using .map()


## useEffect()

    In react ,useEffect is a Hook that lets you perform side effect
    in functional component.
    Side Efect are task that happends  outside the normal react process ,like:

            Fetch data from an API
            Updating the browser
            starting/stoping timers

    syntex:

        useEffect(()=>{
            //code
        },[dependencie1,dependencie2....])

    API integration by fetch,axios

## useRef()

    useRef is a reacct hook that given you a box(.current) you can store anything 
    in- num,str,obj,function,even DOM element,array.

    that valuue persists between renders

    Updating it does not causes your component to re-render.

    {current:value}

## useContext()

    Passing data from a parent component down to deeply nested child component is annoying.

    Normally ,you'd have to pass props manually through each level (called props)

    useContext lets you skip all the middle components and share data directly.

            create a context
            Provide a value
            Consume the value

## useReducer()

    Syntex:
        const [state,dispatch]=useReducer(reducerFunction,initialState)

        state-- current state (like usestate value)
        dispatch(action)-- a function to  tell the  reducer what do do
        reducerFunction(state,action)-- the logic that return a new state
        initialState-- starting value


## useCallBack()

    Every time a component re-render, it creates a brand-new copy of function 
    insside it.

    Even if the function's code looks exactly the same.

    react sees it as different because it's a new object in menory.

    Syntex:

        const variable_name=useCallBack(()=>{
            //code
        },[declearing,dependencie2,......])

## Routing in react && nested routing

    Routing means navigating between different pages in a web applaciation
    without refreshing the browser.

    In Tradition webSites ,Clicking a link reloades the whole Applications.

    In react (a single page application) routing lets us changes the view without reloading.

                Better performance (no full page reloads)
                Smooth user experience
                Control over navigation without server request.

    commend: npm install react-router-dom

    Structure:

            <BrouserRouter>
            <Routes>
            <Route path="address path" element={<component1/>}/>
            <Route path="address path" element={<component2/>}/>
            <Route path="address path" element={<component3/>}/>
            <Routes path="address path" element={<component4/>}/>
            </Routes>
            </BrouserRouter>

            BrouserRouter
                it is the main wrapper component for   routing in React app.
                It enables navigating using the browser URL's  (history)

            Routes
                It contains all the <Route/> component
                It tells react Router which component to show for which path
            
            Route

                Defines a specific url path and which component should lood  for
                the path.

## useNavigate() --- routing dom

    useNavigate  is used to navigating between page as logica;lly.

## Useparam() -- routing dom

        useParams() is a React Router hook that lets you read dynamic values from the URL path (not from the query string).

		It’s commonly used when you have routes with dynamic segments like /users/:id or /products/:productId.
