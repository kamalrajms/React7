## react intro

    What is React?

    1) React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) developed by Facebook (Meta) for building user interfaces (UIs), especially Single Page Applications (SPAs).

    2) It helps developers build reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes.

    Instead of reloading a whole webpage when something changes, React updates only the parts of the UI that need to change.

    -------
    Why do we need React?

	It makes UI development faster, cleaner, and more efficient.

	Provides a better user experience with smooth updates without page reloads.

## useState()

    useState is a react hook that allows you to add state (data that can 
    changes over time) to a functional component.

    normally , in js functions ,variables disappear after the function runs,but
    with useState ,  react remember values between re-renders.

    syntex: 
        const[state,setState]=useState(initiate_state)

        state---the current value of the state variable.
        setState--- a function that updates the state.
        initiate_state-- the starting value  of the state.
